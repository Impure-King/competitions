                Ever since the start of 10th grade, I have feverishly participated in math competitions.
                It was an extremely ennlightening experience for me, due to the amount of preparation and info-gathering I had to do.
            </p>
            <p class="introduction-text">
                Additionally, it has greatly strengthened my math skills allowing for me to discover creative solutions and enjoy the essense of math.
                Throughout the journey, I realized that collection information and resources was the key to success. 
                However, not all the information was equally helpful and often wasted more time than actually helped. 
                Therefore, I have currated this list, so that future aspirants can invest more time into problem solving,
                rather parsing broken links and recorrecting.

                The Art of Problem Solving (abbreviated AoPS) has a lot of great problem solving resources that are a must for any math contenstant.
                It includes a lot of written solutions, previous tests, forums, and even books specially geared towards accelerating learning and ensuring success.
